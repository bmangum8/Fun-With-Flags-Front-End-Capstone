# Fun With Flags: A Vexillology Quiz App

Test your flag knowledge!

## Application Overview

Fun With Flags is a quiz application that allows the user to practice matching a flag to the country it represents. 

I built this application using React, and I used reactstrap and css for styling. My goals were to use an API to fetch my data, further my understanding of React Hooks, and provide the capability for the user to create, read, use, and delete data. 

## Features

Users will see a random flag and match the flag to its country. 
Users can click on the hints buttons to see the country's capital, language, and/or subregion. 
Users choose a country from a dropdown menu and click the submit button.
While playing, users can add a flag to their favorites list (and come back to it later).
Users can add and edit notes about the flags in their favorites list.
Users can delete the flags in their favorites list.
